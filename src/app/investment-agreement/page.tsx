          <p>
            1.1. Investments made through the Otonom Fund platform are in early-stage projects, primarily in the Artificial Intelligence sector. These investments carry significant risk, including the potential for total loss of invested capital.

          <p>
            1.2. The tokens received in exchange for investment represent a stake or utility within the specific project invested in, as defined by that project&apos;s tokenomics and whitepaper. Otonom Fund is a platform facilitating these investments and does not guarantee the performance or success of any project.
          </p>
